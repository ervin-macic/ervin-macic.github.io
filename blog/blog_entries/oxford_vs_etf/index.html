        <p class="blog-post-meta">Jul 17, 2025</p>
        <h4>Motivation</h4>
        <p>
          I wrote this post to share my (unique) university experience with the hope that it 
          might help someone who finds themself in a similar situation, possibly weighing their university options. 
          I also hope that it will be a good read for those who are curious about how things look like at Oxford or at ETF Sarajevo. 
        </p> 
        
        <h4>Context</h4>
        <p> 
        As of the time of writing this post, I just finished the first year of the integrated Master's 
        course Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Oxford. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Before coming to Oxford I studied at ETF Sarajevo, a public faculty part of University of Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
        which is unofficially known to be the best engineering faculty in the country.
        </p>
        <p>
        I received my Oxford offer in January 2023 but didn't start my studies that year due to a lack of funding.
        In the first part of 2024, I managed to secure funding and started the first year again at Oxford in October 2024.
        Before that, I finished the first year of the <em>"Računarstvo i Informatika"</em> course at ETF — the closest equivalent to Computer Science 
        at other universities.
        It is 3 years long and is a Bachelor's course in engineering.
        </p>

          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>
        At Oxford, the 4 year long course is an integrated Master's course, meaning that the first three years comprise a 
        Bachelor's course and the fourth year is a Master's course.
        The years are split as:
        <ul>
            <li><b>First year</b> - <em>Prelims</em></li>
            <li><b>Second year</b> - <em>Part A</em></li>
            <li><b>Third year</b> - <em>Part B</em></li>
            <li><b>(Master) Fourth year</b> - <em>Part C</em></li>
        </ul>
        Interestingly, after finishing the first three years at Oxford, you have the option to leave with a Bachelor's degree
        or continue to the fourth year and get a Master's degree.

        <h4>Structure of University</h4>
        <p>
        ETF is not a university. It is a faculty of the University of Sarajevo. 
        University of Oxford is a university. I am a student at Pembroke College, one of more than 30 different colleges 
        at the University of Oxford.
        </p>
        <p>
          A key difference is that a faculty in Sarajevo is topic-specific, meaning that it only has students studying a range of related topics 
          (e.g. ETF is focused on topics related to electrical engineering). 
          Colleges at Oxford are not topic-specific, meaning that they have students studying
          a vast variety of topics (e.g. Pembroke College has students studying Maths, Computer Science, Philosophy, Biology, History, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          A college is a community of students and staff. Pembroke College has around 400 students and around 100 staff.
          I live in college accommodation and I eat my meals in the college dining hall. But my lectures and labs are at the subject 
          departments (the Mathematical Institute and the Computer Science Department) and not in the college. In terms of academics, I usually have 
          only some tutorials in my college. The rest of my tutorials are either at different colleges or at the subject departments.
        </p>

        <h4>Structure of the academic year</h4>

        <h5>ETF</h5>
        <p>
        At ETF there are 2 semesters: roughly one from early October to the middle of January (called the <b>Winter semester</b>) and one from 
        early March to the middle of July (called the <b>Summer semester</b>), <b>totaling to around 8 months of academic time</b>.
        The final exams are usually in the last two weeks of the semesters and there are midterms throughout the semester. There are retakes of exams that 
        are held in September where you (usually) get two more chances to pass the exams. Retakes of whole subjects are also possible (not just of one particular 
        exam).
        </p>
        <h5>Oxford</h5>
        <p>
        At Oxford, the year is split into 3 terms called: <b>Michaelmas</b> (October to December), <b>Hilary</b> (January to March) and <b>Trinity</b> (April to June).
        Each term is two months long, <b>totaling to 6 months of academic time</b>. So Oxford's academic year is shorter. The exams are held at the end of Trinity term and are called Finals.
        </p>

        <h4>Grading system</h4>

        <h5>ETF</h5>
        <p>
        At ETF Sarajevo, the grades are given in the range from 6 to 10:
        <ul>
          <li><em>55 - 64:</em> 6</li>
          <li><em>65 - 74:</em> 7</li>
          <li><em>75 - 84:</em> 8</li>
          <li><em>85 - 94:</em> 9</li>
          <li><em>95 - 100:</em> 10</li>
        </ul>
        If you score below 55, you fail the exam and must retake it. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Fortunately, at ETF Sarajevo, you can retake an 
        exam multiple times—up to 3-4 times for some subjects. You can also defer passing some
        subjects to the next academic year, although this means more exams to pass next year.
        </p>
        <h5>Oxford</h5>
        <p>
        <b>The grading system at Oxford is more confusing than at ETF Sarajevo.</b>
        At Oxford, during the first year, you can only get a <b>Fail, Pass</b> or <b>Distinction</b>. During the second, third and 
        fourth years, 
        you can get a <b>First, 2.1, 2.2, 3</b> or <b>Fail</b>.
        The grades are given as follows:
        <ul>
          <li><em>0 - 39:</em> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Fail</span></li>
          <li><em>40 - 49:</em> <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">Pass</span> (in Parts A,B,C this is called a 3 or Third)</li>
          <li><em>50 - 59:</em> <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">Pass</span> (in Parts A,B,C this is called a 2.2)</li>
          <li><em>60 - 69:</em> <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">Pass</span> (in Parts A,B,C this is called a 2.1)</li>
          <li><em>70 - 100:</em> <span style="color: gold; font-weight: bold;">Pass with Distinction</span> (in Parts A,B,C this is called a First)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The majority of people get a 2.1 or a 2.2 </p>

        <h6>Raw marks vs UMS</h6>

        <b>The Oxford grading system is based on a curve.</b>
        This means that the grades are not given based on your raw marks but rather on your 
        relative score with respect to the cohort (called uniform mark scale - UMS). Your UMS is usually higher than your 
        raw marks when the exam is hard and lower when the exam is easy.
      </p> 
        <p>
        For example, after finishing my Analysis paper I was convinced that I scored <b>90+</b> in raw marks but had a UMS of <b>86</b> in 
        the end likely due to the fact that the exam was 
        not insanely hard and it seems that many people scored high. 
        </p>
        <p>
        On the other hand, after finishing my Imperative Programming and 
        Introduction to Proof Systems exam I thought I had done very poorly to the point where I got concerned whether 
        I would pass the exam 
        but my UMS was <b>72</b> (way above the <b>40</b> threshold for passing) so it seems that the paper was very hard
        for the whole cohort and not just for me.
        </p> 

        <h5>My grades</h5>
        <p>
        At ETF Sarajevo I had a final score of <b>9.8/10</b> which was the highest score in my cohort. 
        At Oxford I had a final score of <b>78.9/100</b> (ranked 11th out of 51 students taking Maths and Computer Science) 
        which is a <b style="color: gold;">Distinction</b> - the highest grade 
        in the first year. For context, getting a 10/10 at ETF and maintaining this score average for the whole 3-year course is 
        hard but not impossible (Naida Purišević did it this year and seems to be the first to have ever done so).
        </p>

        <h5>International students (digression)</h5>
        <p>
          The following is the number of students from each country that are studying Computer Science, Mathematics and Computer Science, or
          Computer Science and Philosophy in their first year at Oxford in 2024/2025:

          British students dominate the cohort with 81 students, followed by China (8), Hong Kong (4), India (4), and Turkey (4).
          In years prior to Brexit, the UK had a much larger number of EU students, but this has significantly decreased since then.
        </p>
        <p>
          UK students are very capable and the majority of them are very well prepared for the course.
          The majority of them have studied A-levels (a UK qualification) and have a strong background in mathematics and computer science.
          Though, the most interesting and impressive people I've met so far are the international students

        <h4>Assessments</h4>

        <p>
          At ETF (and in other Bologna-based systems), there is a strong emphasis on <b>continuous assessment</b>—including midterms, assignments, oral exams, labs, group work, and final exams—unlike at Oxford. 
          ETF offers more opportunities to take exams, which can make it easier to achieve good grades.
          Continuous assessment reduces the pressure on final exams. Importantly, exams typically cover only the material from the current semester—often just the final few weeks—so there's less total content to revise 
          </p><p>
          At Oxford, final exams are the only official assessments, and they are <b>cumulative</b>, meaning you're tested on material from all three terms. At the beginning of each semester we do have <em>"collections"</em>, which are mock exams that have no 
          impact on official grades but are used to assess ones understanding of the material from the previous 
          term. These are typically easier than the finals and are not cumulative by design. Doing well on collections is not a 
          guarantee that you will do well on the finals and they have no impact on your final grade at all, as mentioned.
          </p>
          <p>
          Interestingly, even the five (challenging) Computer Science labs I completed at Oxford didn't contribute to my final grade. 
          However, failing a lab meant failing the subject.
          </p>
          <p> 
          For example, I was assessed on material from early October in late June—a 9-month gap. This promotes a different
          way of studying and learning where you need to be able to recall the material from the whole year and not just the last semester.
          This is one of the biggest differences between ETF and Oxford. 
          </p><p>
          At ETF, you can get away with forgetting the material from the first semester
          and just focusing on the second semester. From firsthand experience, I found it much harder to recall material at ETF, 
          and my knowledge felt more "unstable" compared to Oxford.
        </p>
        <h5>Retaking exams</h5>
        <p>
        While retaking exams at Oxford is possible, it is <b>significantly more difficult than at ETF</b>. The resits take place in September
        and if you manage to fail any resit you fail the entire academic year. <b>In conclusion, passing exams at Oxford isn't 
          much harder than passing exams at ETF but getting good grades is much, much harder.</b>
        </p>
        <h4>Exam conditions</h4>
        <p>
          <b>The exams at Oxford are much more formal than at ETF.</b> The exams are held in a large hall with hundreds of students
          and you are not allowed to bring any notes, books, electronics, etc. You are only allowed to bring
          a pen, a pencil, an eraser, a ruler, and a calculator (if allowed for the subject) in a clear zip-lock bag (no pencil cases
          allowed).

        </div> 
          </p><p>
          Exams usually last 2-3 hours, and you're not permitted to leave the hall until the end of the exam except for ocassional 
          bathroom breaks if one needs them (although, to be honest, the exam is so stressful that I don't think (m)any people do this). 
          You are not allowed to talk to anyone while inside the exam hall. It feels much closer to the IMO than to ETF exams.
          </p><p>
          The exams are usually held in the morning. You are allowed to bring a water bottle but it must be transparent and you 
          are not allowed to eat any snacks during the exam.
          </p><p>
          You <b>must</b> wear a formal attire (suit, shirt, bowtie). Unfortunately, this means that even
          when it's 30+ degrees Celsius outside, you must wear black dress shoes, dress trousers, and wear or carry a suit with your 
          "sub fusc" (gown)
          to the exam venue (and the exam hall is 3 kilometers distance from where you live). Once seated, you're allowed to remove your suit and gown.

              (that they will leave in the tent before entering the building). It's loud and crowded. Interestingly, most people have pink flowers 
              on their suits, meaning that 
              they have taken at least one exam before this one.

        <h4>Subjects</h4>
        <h5>Caveats</h5>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">
        My course at Oxford is <strong>definitely not</strong> an engineering course. The course I partially attended at ETF was called Computer Science 
        but felt closer to Computer Engineering or just Engineering during the first year. <b>The comparison is not perfect.</b>
        </p>
        <p> ETF has more <em>breadth</em>—we covered a wide range of topics quickly but superficially, and Oxford has more <em>depth</em> (we went through less content in the 
          same amount of time but dug deep into important details). 
        </p>
        <p>Graduating from ETF would likely make you a stronger software engineer than after finishing Oxford. After finishing Oxford, you would likely be 
          a better researcher/academic than after finishing ETF. Though, people that finish Oxford are usually very capable (can learn hard things 
          fast) and desirable in the job market.
        </p>
        <p>
        As one would expect, the first year of undergraduate study is not very specialized. It is essentially 
        an introduction to the field. I initially believed that much of my knowledge from ETF would carry over to Oxford. I was mostly wrong—and I'll explain why below.
        </p>
        <h5>Oxford</h5>

        <h5>ETF</h5>

        <p>
        At ETF I studied the following subjects: Mathematics I, Mathematics II, Linear Algebra, Physics I, 
        Introductory Programming in C, Programming Techniques in C++, 
        Mathematical Logic and Computability Theory, Probability and Statistics, and Operating Systems.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Out of all the courses, I especially enjoyed Mathematics II, Linear Algebra, and Programming Techniques in C++.
The mathematics courses were very engineering-oriented—much closer to calculus than to pure analysis. Linear Algebra was based on MIT's 18.06 course, which I found excellent and well-structured.
Programming Techniques in C++ was both practical and well-taught: it covered core C++ programming as well as use of the Standard Template Library (STL).
By the end of the course, I felt I had gained tangible programming knowledge and skills that I could immediately apply in practice.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Direct comparison</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>What worked better at ETF?</h4>
        <h5>Not much collaboration at Oxford</h5>
        <p>
          At Oxford, I had to learn how to work independently. At ETF, there was a strong sense of team spirit—students often discussed homework problems, helped one another, and collaborated on projects. That wasn't my experience at Oxford. I didn't attempt a single problem sheet question with anyone else.
This isn't to say that collaboration doesn't happen at Oxford, but rather that such a culture wasn't very present at my college. At St John's, I noticed that the most successful students tended to work together regularly, and I often felt I was missing out on something valuable.
In the coming years, I hope to actively seek out more opportunities to collaborate—especially with students outside of my own college.
        </p>

        <h5>Programming wasn't that good at Oxford</h5>
        <h6>Imperative programming</h6>
        <p>
          The C++ programming course at ETF, taught by Željko Jurić, was highly practical and equipped me with tangible programming skills. In contrast, the Imperative Programming 
          course in Scala at Oxford felt significantly less effective. This was largely due to structural changes in the curriculum: what used to be three 
          separate modules—Imperative Programming 1, 2, and 3—spanning Hilary and Trinity terms, is now compressed into a single 8-week course.
As a result, the content feels rushed and less thoughtfully delivered. Moreover, while the C++ course at ETF emphasized hands-on work and practical application, 
the Scala course at Oxford did not provide the same level of engagement. This is understandable to some extent—Oxford terms are short, and students are juggling several 
demanding subjects simultaneously. But the compressed structure makes it nearly impossible to implement substantial programming exercises like those we tackled in the C++ course.
That's unfortunate, because I've spoken to several Oxford graduates who feel they didn't spend nearly enough time actually programming during their degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Imperative Programming course at Oxford placed a strong emphasis on formal methods—such as invariants, variants, pre- and postconditions, and datatype 
          invariants—to ensure code correctness. While this theoretical foundation is valuable, the course lacked a practical dimension. I believe the course would 
          benefit greatly from a more hands-on approach, similar to the C++ course at ETF, which provided extensive programming practice. 
          A more balanced integration of formal reasoning and real-world coding experience would make the course both more engaging and more effective, in my opinion.
        </p>

        <h6>Functional programming</h6>
        <p>
          The Functional Programming course in Haskell was very <em>interesting...</em> Coming in with a significant amount of programming experience, I was
          surprised that this course was the first computer science course of the degree. It's rumoured that they assume everyone 
          has solid programming experience in an imperative programming languages prior to starting their degree at Oxford. Some say that FP is taught 
          first precisely because most students are unfamiliar with it, which helps level the playing field and keeps the term interesting for everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            This course was hard. It felt like you were supposed to have read at least one book on Haskell before starting the course.
          </p>
        <p>
          The course was strange to say the least. I think learning functional programming 
          before some C-like language is a mistake.

        </div>
        <h5>No geometric intuition</h5>
        <p>
          The most drastic difference between ETF and Oxford when it comes to mathematics was how linear algebra was taught.
          At ETF, we were encouraged to use geometric intuition and visualizations of the concepts. We would draw planes, vectors, and 
          hyperplanes to solve certain problems. At Oxford, we had none of that. The linear algebra course was very abstract and
          <b>we didn't draw a single plane or vector for the whole duration of the course</b>. The course was very algebraic and 
          abstract, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it was a big change for me. I had to learn to think in a more abstract way and not 
          rely on my well-developed geometric intuition. AS mentioned, ETF's Linear Algebra was based on MIT's 18.06 Linear 
          Algebra course. This course is very geometric and visual due to the approach of Gilbert Strang.
          <p>
          <em> This is an example where I felt that my knowledge from ETF was not very useful to me, and even a hindrance at times (as the lack 
            of visualization frustrated me). I had similar issues with Analysis where I felt that things were moving too slow at Oxford. </em>
            </p>
          <p>
          For reference, I scored 99.5/100 on Linear Algebra at ETF and 81/100 on Mathematics 1 
          (an exam that encompasses Linear Algebra and Groups) at Oxford.
          </p>
        <p>
          I don't regret taking the MIT version of Linear Algebra at ETF as it was a good course and I learned a lot from it. Now that it doesn't
          affect my performance on exams, I cherrish the fact that I have these two very distinct approaches to linear algebra "mastered".

        <h4> What worked better at Oxford?</h4>
        <h5>Much, much greater focus on self study</h5>
        <p>
          I would say that I spent more than 70% of my academic time at Oxford doing work in my room. For me this would usually mean I would spend
          around 4-6 hours per day working on problem sheets, reading books, lecture notes, and studying for exams.
        </p>
        <h6>A typical day</h6>
        <p>
          At ETF, my day would look like: 
          <ul>
            <li>Wake up between 7 and 8 AM.</li>
            <li>Take the bus (25-50 minutes) to get to Sarajevo.</li>
            <li>Listen to lectures that last 45 minutes from 9 AM to around 2 PM.</li>
            <li>On most days, I stay longer because of tutorials.</li>
            <li>I would usually leave around 3 PM and arrive back home (if I wasn't working that day) at around 4:30 PM</li>
          </ul>
          At Oxford, my day would look like:
          <ul>
            <li>Wake up between 8 and 9 AM. </li>
            <li>Walk to lectures at the department of Maths or CS from my college (15 minutes). Most times I would walk with
              friends from my college.
            </li>
            <li>Attend letures from 10 AM to 2 PM at the latest. Most days I would only have around 2.5 hours of lectures.</li>
            <li> Walk back to college and have lunch at 12:00.</li>
            <li> Go back to my room and work on problem sheets until tutorials/revision classes start. Each tutorial lasts an hour and 
              we usually have 2-4 tutorials per week.
            </li>
            <li> Have dinner at 5 PM. </li>
            <li> Work and rest from 5 PM to 11:30 PM. </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, I would spend less time in formal lectures or tutorials at Oxford than at ETF. I would use the extra 
          time to work by myself in my room.
        </p>
        <h5>Tutorials</h5>
        <h6>Tutorials at ETF</h6>
        <p> The tutorials I had at ETF were not effective. The issue, in my opinion, is that students don't try the problems by themselves 
          before the tutorial class where the tutor solves them. This means that the students don't learn how to solve the problems by themselves and
          ultimately creates a huge waste of time for 95% of students. It's usually not the students' fault that they don't try the problems by themselves 
          prior to the tutorial as the problems are usually released quite late and close to the actual tutorial (at times, we only got the questions after 
          the tutorial had already started). What I always did was try to solve the problems before the tutor covers them during the tutorial. Usually the 
          questions weren't too hard I would actually manage to do this. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The tutorials at ETF are also held in a large classroom with around 20-30 students. The tutor usually solves the problems on the board and explains them to the class.
          Usually what happens is that some students just copy down the tutor's solution in their notebooks and then go home and either forget about it or 
          waste time later trying to understand the solution (which again, is not as effective as trying to solve the problem by yourself).
        </p>
        <h6>Tutorials at Oxford</h6>
        <p>
          At Oxford, the tutorials are much more effective. The tutors expect you to have tried the problems before the tutorial and they will 
          ask you to explain your solution to the problem. This means that you actually learn how to solve the problems by yourself and not just 
          listen to the tutor solving them for you. The tutors at Oxford are also much more knowledgeable and experienced than the tutors at ETF.
          They are usually PhD students or postdocs who have a lot of experience in teaching and usually know how to explain things well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tutorials are usually 1 tutor and 2-3 students per tutorial. This means that you get a lot of individual attention and
          you can ask questions and get help with the problems you struggled with. The tutors are also very approachable and 
          willing to help you with any questions you have. This is something that I really like about the Oxford tutorials.
          Some tutors are very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject they teach. Some just want to get the job done.
        </p>
        <h6>Tutorials at ETF vs Oxford</h6>
        <p>
          Having said this, I didn't find the Oxford tutorials immensely more helpful than the ETF tutorials. At ETF, I still had a direct 
          connection to the tutors. I would often ask questions and get help with the problems 
          I struggled with without hessitation. <b> In conclusion, ETF had tutorials where you'd come and listen to someone explain solutions to problems you've not attempted,
            at Oxford you have tutorials where you come and listen to someone explain solutions to problem you've likely already solved. I much prefer the latter.
          </b>
        </p>
        <h5>Selling point (digression)</h5>
        <p> The tutorial system is one of the main selling points of Oxbridge. The tuition for international students for Maths and 
          Computer Science is around £50,000 per year. Including living costs which amount to around £15,000 per year, the total cost of studying at Oxford
          is around <b>£65,000</b> per year (amounting to around <b>£200,000</b> for a 3-year course when including inflation).  
          I think that this is an insane amount of money to pay for a degree. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Domestic students pay around £9,250 per year for tuition and around £15,000 for living costs, totaling to around £24,250 per year (around £72,750 for a 3-year course).
          This is a lot of money for a UK student but it is not nearly as much as for an international student. <b>International students pay around 5 times as much tuition.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Tutorials are private in nature. <b>One tutor tutors one to two students at a time. You essentially have a 1 hour private lesson from the tutor.</b> Usually 
            tutorials are held in other colleges where the tutor is based.

        <h5>Getting the best grade requires at least 70% while at ETF it's 95%</h5>
        <p> Why is the bar so low for achieving the best grade at Oxford? Because the exams are exceptionally challenging and require genuinely novel ideas to solve. 
          These questions aren’t designed to be tackled through rote learning or by applying memorized formulas. Instead, they go far beyond simply testing your 
          understanding of the material or your ability to apply it to slightly unfamiliar situations—they assess your capacity to generate new ideas and apply 
          them creatively to unfamiliar problems. </p> 

        <p> This is one of the things I really appreciate about Oxford exams. After completing my first year, I 
        genuinely feel like I’ve become smarter and more capable across a range of intellectual tasks—a transformation I attribute largely to the demands of 
        the exam system. </p> 

        <p> At ETF, by contrast, the emphasis was never on coming up with new ideas or applying them in novel ways. Success there was 
        about being mechanically proficient at applying formulas and relying on rote memorization. During exams, my focus was often on how many marks I might 
        lose, rather than how many I could earn. At Oxford, the mindset was completely different—the questions were so difficult that I found myself thinking 
        only about how many marks I could gain, not about what I might lose. </p> 

        <p> Another aspect of ETF that I found frustrating was the awarding of bonus 
        points for unrelated or trivial tasks—like filling out a survey—which could push students’ scores beyond 100%. At times, I even sensed that some professors 
        were more generous to stronger students, awarding them more points than their work likely deserved. I noticed this in some of my own results as well. 
        This atmosphere made the course feel more relaxed and less academically serious, which I didn’t find motivating. </p>

        <p> In contrast, one of the main forces driving me to push my limits at Oxford was the intensity and seriousness of the exam system. 
        <strong>The fact that none of your coursework contributes to your final grade—and that your performance in the final exams determines your 
        result entirely—was a powerful motivator.</strong> </p>

        <h5>(Shocking) Oxford is much more academically demanding</h5>

        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <p class="mb-0 small"><em>"Students should seek advice from their tutors if they find it impossible to meet their academic obligations without 
          spending significantly longer than 48 hours per week on academic study on a regular basis."</em></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
        The academic workload at Oxford was significantly greater than what I experienced at ETF—easily two to three times more per week. 
        Each week, we were given four to five problem sheets, each containing five to ten questions. The problems were often quite challenging and 
        time-consuming, especially the final one or two questions on each sheet, which were usually optional and intended to stretch the strongest students. 
        Nevertheless, most high-achieving students attempted them—driven either by personal ambition or subtle social pressure from peers.
        </p>

        <p>
        I typically spent four to six hours on each problem sheet, totaling around 20 hours per week just on problem sets. 
        In addition, we completed multiple lab assignments throughout the year: two for Functional Programming, two for Imperative Programming, 
        and one for Design and Analysis of Algorithms.
        </p>

        <p>
        This constant stream of academic work left me with relatively little time to relax or focus on non-university activities. 
        For the last four weeks of both Hilary and Trinity terms, I spent nearly all of my time on university-related tasks. 
        In contrast, at ETF I would often begin preparing for midterms just a few days before the exam, and still consistently ranked among 
        the top three students in my cohort—typically losing only 1-3 points per exam. While ETF did require effort during the semester, the intensity 
        and consistency of the workload were not remotely comparable to Oxford.
        </p>

        <h5>Oxford pushes your boundaries</h5>
        <p>
        As mentioned above, the exams at Oxford are hard and require you to come up with new ideas and apply them to the problems at hand.
        When I say new ideas, I mean that you have to come up with a new way of solving the problem, usually something that you haven't seen before.
        This reminded me a lot of math competitions like the IMO (but of course not as hard). ETF had almost none of this. People put in more effort
        to come up with interesting questions at Oxford.
        </p>
        <div class="px-5 pt-2 my-2 text-center">
          <figure style="margin: 0;">
            <img src="/images/blog/oxford_vs_etf/oxford/probability_problem_sheet_question.png" alt="Problem sheet question" style="width: 100%; height: auto; max-width: 600px; border-radius: 12px;" onclick="openLightbox(this)" class="gallery-img">
            <figcaption style="margin-top: 0.5rem; font-size: 0.9rem; color: #6c757d;">
              This question was particularly interesting because it required you to think outside the box. It reminded me of some IMO problems.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>
          As an example, take a look at this <a href="/images/blog/oxford_vs_etf/oxford/probabilityps5.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          probability problem sheet</a>. It's interesting because it has a lot of questions that aren't standard and require you to think (a bit) 
          outside the box (especially the last question which took me a long time to fully solve).
        </p>
        <p>
          Analysis was hard and required a lot of creativity for certain questions. Here's an example of a question that I found interesting:
        </p>
        <div class="px-5 pt-2 my-2 text-center">
          <figure style="margin: 0;">
            <img src="/images/blog/oxford_vs_etf/oxford/analysis2_cool_question.png" alt="Analysis cool question" style="width: 100%; height: auto; max-width: 600px; border-radius: 12px;" onclick="openLightbox(this)" class="gallery-img">
            <figcaption style="margin-top: 0.5rem; font-size: 0.9rem; color: #6c757d;">
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>
          In Computer Science, the Design and Analysis of Algorithms course was very interesting and required a lot of creativity to solve the problems. Here's a question
            that we had on a problem sheet but is also a <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/description/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
              LeetCode hard problem: Merge k sorted lists.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          I pushed through a personal boundary in this course. I managed to prove to myself that I can solve hard algorithmic problems even though I didn't go to 
          the IOI (International Olympiad in Informatics) to which a proportion of the students in my year have gone and won medals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Continuous Maths, a course that is a mix of Vector Calculus and Numerical Methods, was pretty advanced for a first-year course. The
          <a href="/images/blog/oxford_vs_etf/oxford/cm-notes.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lecture notes</a> were quite long and chock full of content.

        <p>
          If you're studying Maths/Computer Science/Statistics at either Oxford or Cambridge, you will likely get a good job after graduation.
          Really good students often go down the "Quantitative Finance" route where starting salaries range £100,000 - £250,000. Some of my friends 
          had internships at Jane Street, Citadel, Optiver and earned around £30,000 - £40,000 for 2-3 months of work. When considering the jobs 
          you could get in Bosnia and Herzegovina, this is an absurdly high salary. Food costs in the UK are actually lower than in Bosnia (if you're smart). 
          The large costs are rent and utilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from high salaries, you can actually pursue academia and research and still earn good money in the UK. There is also many grants and 
          opportunities for promising researchers (some of my tutors got grants upwards of £400,000 to work on their research).
        </p>
        
        <h3>Concluding remarks</h3>
        <p>
          If someone were to give me the opportunity to go back in time and immediately start my degree at Oxford after finishing high school, I would decline. 
          I am happy that I had the opportunity to study at ETF Sarajevo and that I was able to meet smart people in Sarajevo. I cherrish the memories I made there. 
          I am happy that when I come back to my country I can 
          call up some of my friends from ETF for a coffee and talk about university experiences, life, and the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          By attending ETF, I got to know the best students and professors in my country. I feel connected to the community of students there and I am happy that 
          I was able to contribute and be a part of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, I am glad I spent a year doing an engineering degree. This gave me a pretty good grounding in reality that helped me in projects I 
          worked on during the year. Sometimes studying at Oxford feels like sitting in an ivory tower and not being able to relate to the real world.
          I got to experience the real world and all its challenges at ETF and in the projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, I had the opportunity to listen to Jurić's lectures. These lectures still hold up for some of the best lectures I have ever attended, beating 
          most Oxford lectures by a significant margin. The subject Jurić teaches called "Tehnike Programiranja" (Programming Techniques) is a very good subject and holds up well to the 
          difficulty of courses I have taken so far at Oxford. I also had the opportunity to listen to a couple of lectures on Numerical Methods by Jurić while on vacation from Oxford. 
          That was a really wholesome throwback.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, I understand the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina much better. I understand the challenges that students face in my country and I am more aware of 
          the problems that exist. I'm optimistic about the prospect of eventually returning to Bosnia and giving back to the community that helped me grow as a person.
