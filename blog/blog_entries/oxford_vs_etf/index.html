        Oxford University - ETF Sarajevo

        <h2 class="blog-post-title"> Oxford vs ETF Sarajevo</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">Jul 17, 2025</p>
        <h4>Motivation</h4>
        <p>
          I decided that I would write this post to share my (unique) experience with the hope that it 
          might help someone who finds themselves in a similar situation weighing their university options. 
          I also hope that it will be an interesting read for anyone interested in the differences between the two courses (and possibly 
          update your beliefs about what studying at a top university looks like). 
        </p> 
        
        <h4>Context</h4>
        <p> 
        As of the time of writing this post, I just finished the first year of the integrated Master's 
        course Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Oxford. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Before coming to Oxford I studied at ETF Sarajevo, a public faculty in Bosnia and Herzegovina unofficially known 
        to be the best engineering faculty in the country. It is part of the larger University of Sarajevo. 
        I received my Oxford offer in January 2023 but didn't start my studies until October 2024 due to a lack of funding 
        which I managed to secure in early 2024.
        I finished the first year of the "Računarstvo i Informatika" (a course somewhere between Computer Science and 
        Computer Engineering) course at ETF.
        This course is 3 years long and is a Bachelor's of Engineering.
        </p>

          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>
        At Oxford, the 4 year long course is an integrated Master's course, meaning that the first three years comprise a 
        Bachelor's course and the fourth year is a Master's course.
        The first year at Oxford is called "Prelims" and it is an introduction to the course.
        The years are split as:
        <ul>
            <li><b>First year</b> - <em>Prelims</em></li>
            <li><b>Second year</b> - <em>Part A</em></li>
            <li><b>Third year</b> - <em>Part B</em></li>
            <li><b>(Master) Fourth year</b> - <em>Part C</em></li>
        </ul>
        Interestingly, after finishing the first three years at Oxford, you can choose to leave with a Bachelor's degree
        or continue to the fourth year and get a Master's degree.

        <h4>Structure of University</h4>
        <p>
        ETF is not a university. It is a faculty of the University of Sarajevo. 
        University of Oxford is a university. I am a student at Pembroke College, one of more than 30 different colleges 
        at the University of Oxford.
        </p>
        <p>
          A key difference is that a faculty in Sarajevo is topic-specific, meaning that it only has students studying a specific topic 
          (e.g. ETF is focused on electrical engineering). Colleges at Oxford are not topic-specific, meaning that they have students studying
          a vast variety of topics (e.g. Pembroke College has students studying Maths, Computer Science, Philosophy, History, etc.).
        </p>
        <p>
          A college is a community of students and staff. Pembroke College has around 400 students and around 100 staff.
          I live in college accommodation and I have my meals in the college dining hall. But my lectures and labs are at the subject 
          departments (the Mathematical Institute and the Computer Science Department) and not in the college. In terms of academics, I usually have 
          only some tutorials in my college. The rest of my tutorials are either at different colleges or at the subject departments.
        </p>

        <h4>Structure of the academic year</h4>

        <h5>ETF</h5>
        <p>
        At ETF there are 2 semesters: roughly one from early October to middle January (called the <b>Winter semester</b>) and one from 
        early March to middle of June (called the <b>Summer semester</b>), <b>totaling to around 8 months of academic time</b>.
        The exams are usually in the last two weeks of the semester and are essentially midterms. There are retakes of exams that 
        are held in September where you (usually) get two more chances to pass the exams.
        </p>
        <h5>Oxford</h5>
        <p>
        At Oxford, the year is split into 3 terms called: <b>Michaelmas</b> (roughly October to December), <b>Hilary</b> (roughly January to March) and <b>Trinity</b> (roughly April to June).
        Each term is roughly two months long, <b>totaling to 6 months of academic time</b>. So Oxford's academic year is shorter. The exams are held at the end of Trinity term and are called Finals.
        </p>

        <h4>Grading system</h4>

        <h5>ETF</h5>
        <p>
        At ETF Sarajevo, the grades are given in the range from 6 to 10:
        <ul>
          <li><em>55 - 64:</em> 6</li>
          <li><em>65 - 74:</em> 7</li>
          <li><em>75 - 84:</em> 8</li>
          <li><em>85 - 94:</em> 9</li>
          <li><em>95 - 100:</em> 10</li>
        </ul>
        If you get below 55, you fail the exam and have to retake the exam. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Luckily, at ETF Sarajevo you can retake an 
        exam multiple times (as far as I know, up to 3-4 times for some subjects). Also, it is possible to delay passing some
        number of subjects to the next year with the obvious caveat of having more exams to pass the next year.
        </p>
        <h5>Oxford</h5>
        <p>
        <b>The grading system at Oxford is more confusing than at ETF Sarajevo.</b>
        At Oxford, during the first year, you can only get a <b>Fail, Pass</b> or <b>Distinction</b>. During the second, third and 
        fourth years, 
        you can get a <b>First, 2.1, 2.2, 3</b> or <b>Fail</b>.
        The grades are given as follows:
        <ul>
          <li><em>0 - 39:</em> <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Fail</span></li>
          <li><em>40 - 49:</em> <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">Pass</span> (in Parts A,B,C this is called a 3 or Third)</li>
          <li><em>50 - 59:</em> <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">Pass</span> (in Parts A,B,C this is called a 2.2)</li>
          <li><em>60 - 69:</em> <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">Pass</span> (in Parts A,B,C this is called a 2.1)</li>
          <li><em>70 - 100:</em> <span style="color: gold; font-weight: bold;">Pass with Distinction</span> (in Parts A,B,C this is called a First)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The majority of people get a 2.1 or a 2.2 </p>
        <h6>Raw marks vs UMS</h6>
        <b>The Oxford grading system is based on a curve.</b>
        This means that the grades are not given based on your raw marks but rather on your 
        relative score with respect to the cohort (called uniform mark scale - UMS). Your UMS is usually higher than your 
        raw marks when the exam is hard and lower when the exam is easy.
      </p> 
        <p>
        For example, after finishing my Analysis paper I was convinced that I scored <b>90+</b> in raw marks but had a UMS of <b>86</b> in 
        the end likely due to the fact that the exam was 
        not insanely hard and it seems that many people scored high. 
        </p>
        <p>
        On the other hand, after finishing my Imperative Programming and 
        Introduction to Proof Systems paper I thought I did very poorly to the point where got conserned whether 
        I would pass the exam 
        but my UMS was <b>72</b> way above the <b>40</b> threshold for passing so it seems that the paper was extremely hard
        for the whole cohort and not just me.
        </p> 

        <h4>My grades</h4>
        <p>
        At ETF Sarajevo I had a final score of <b>9.8/10</b> which was the highest score in my cohort. 
        At Oxford I had a final score of <b>78.9/100</b> (ranked 11th out of 51 students taking Maths and Computer Science) 
        which is a <b style="color: gold;">Distinction</b> - the highest grade 
        in the first year. For context, getting a 10/10 at ETF and maintaining this score average for the whole 3-year course is 
        hard but not impossible (one person, Naida Purišević, did it this year and seems to be the first to have done so).
        </p>

        <h4>International students (digression)</h4>
        <p>
          The following is the number of students from each country that are studying Computer Science, Mathematics and Computer Science, or
          Computer Science and Philosophy in their first year at Oxford in 2024/2025.

        <h4>Assessments</h4>

        <p>
          At ETF (and other Bologna-based schooling systems) there is a great focus on <b>continuous assessment</b>: midterms, assignments, oral exams, 
          labs, group work, and finals 
          which is not the case at Oxford. ETF makes it easier to get good grades by having multiple opportunities to take exams and 
          also by having a continuous assessment system there is less pressure on the finals. Importantly, there is less total knowledge 
          to bring to exams as in most cases you only need to know the material from the semester you are in (not even the whole semester, but
          rather the last few weeks as each semester has a midterm and a final exam which usually cover different material). 
          </p><p>
          At Oxford, the finals are the only exams and they are <b>cumulative</b>, meaning that you need to know the material from all 
          three terms (you are assessed on the whole year at once). At the beginning of each semester we do have <em>"collections"</em> which are
          mock exams that don't have any impact on our scores but are used to assess ones understanding of the material from the previous 
          term. These are typically easier than the finals and are not cumulative by design. Doing well on collections is not a 
          guarantee that you will do well on the finals and they have no impact on your final grade at all, as mentioned.
          </p>
          <p>
          Interestingly, at Oxford, even the 5 (challenging) labs I had in Computer Science didn't contribute
          to my final grade at all. Although, failing a lab meant failing the subject. 
          </p>
          <p> 
          For example, I was finally assessed on material from early October in late June (a <b>9-month gap</b>). This promotes a different
          way of studying and learning where you need to be able to recall the material from the whole year and not just the last semester.
          This is one of the biggest difference between ETF and Oxford. 
          </p><p>
          At ETF, you can get away with forgetting the material from the first semester
          and just focusing on the second semester. From first hand experience, I have felt how hard it was to recall material 
          at ETF and how much 
          more "unstable" my knowledge was compared to Oxford. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Compared to ETF, <b>retaking exams at Oxford is possible but not nearly as easy.</b> The resits take place in September
        and if you manage to fail any resit you fail the whole year. <b>In conclusion, passing exams at Oxford isn't 
          much harder than passing exams at ETF but getting good grades is much, much harder.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>The exams at Oxford are much more formal than at ETF.</b> The exams are held in a large hall with hundreds of students
          and you are not allowed to bring any notes, books, electronics, etc. You are only allowed to bring
          a pen, a pencil, an eraser, a ruler, and a calculator (if allowed for the subject) in a clear zip-lock bag (no pencil cases
          allowed).

          </p><p>
          The exams are usually 2-3 hours long and you are not allowed to leave the exam hall until the end of the exam except for ocassional 
          bathroom breaks if one needs them (although, to be honest, the exam is so stressful that I don't think (m)any people do this). 
          You are not allowed to talk to anyone while inside the exam hall. It feels much closer to the IMO than to ETF exams.
          </p><p>
          The exams are usually held in the morning. You are allowed to bring a water bottle but it must be transparent and you 
          are not allowed to eat snacks during the exam.
          </p><p>
          You <b>must</b> wear a formal attire (suit, shirt, bowtie). Unfortunately, this means that even
          when it's 30+ degrees Celsius outside, you must wear black dress shoes, dress trowsers, and wear or carry a suit with your 
          "sub fusc" (gown)
          to the exam venue (and the exam hall is 3 kilometers distance from where you live). Once you're seated, you can take off the suit

              on their suits, meaning that 
              they have taken at least one exam before this one.

        <h4>Subjects</h4>
        <h5>Caveats</h5>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">
        My course at Oxford is <strong>definitely not</strong> an engineering course. The course I partially attended at ETF was called Computer Science 
        but felt closer to Computer Engineering or just Engineering during the first year. <b>The comparison is not perfect.</b>
        </p>
        <p> ETF has more <em>breadth</em> (we went fast through lots of content superficially), and Oxford has more <em>depth</em> (we went through less content in the 
          same amount of time but dug deep into important details). 
        </p>
        <p>After finishing ETF, you would likely be a better software engineer than after finishing Oxford. After finishing Oxford, you would likely be 
          a better researcher/academic than after finishing ETF. Though, people that finish Oxford are usually very capable (can learn hard things 
          fast) and desirable in the job market.
        </p>
        <p>
        As one would expect, the first year of undergraduate study is not very specialized. It is essentially 
        an introduction to the field. I held the belief that this would imply that some, if not most, 
        of my knowledge from ETF would be useful at Oxford. <b>I was mostly wrong and I will go into this in 
        detail below. </b>
        </p>
        <h5>Oxford</h5>

        <h5>ETF</h5>

        <p>
        At ETF I took the following subjects: Mathematics I, Mathematics II, Linear Algebra, Physics I, 
        Introductory Programming in C, Programming Techniques in C++, 
        Mathematical Logic and Computability Theory, Probability and Statistics, and Operating Systems.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Out of these, I really liked Mathematics II, Linear Algebra and Programming Techniques in C++. 
          The Mathematics courses 
          were very engineering-oriented, much closer to calculus than analysis. Linear Algebra was taught based on the MIT 
          course 18.06 Linear Algebra which is a very good course. Programming Techniques in C++ was a very good and 
          practical course that taught us how to program in C++ and how to use the STL. After finishing this course, I 
          felt that I had gotten tangible programming knowledge and skills that I could apply in practice.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Direct comparison</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>What worked better at ETF?</h4>
        <h5>Not much collaboration at Oxford</h5>
        <p>
          Had to learn to work alone at Oxford. At ETF, there was a "team spirit" where people would discuss progress on 
          homework exercises, help each other, and work together on projects. At Oxford, this was not the case for me. Not a single
          problem sheet question was attempted with anyone else. This is not to say that people at Oxford don't work together,
          but rather that this kind of culture wasn't present at my college. At St John's, I had the impression that the most successful 
          students worked together quite often and I really felt like I was missing out on something. This is something that I hope to
          improve in the coming years, to go out of my way to work with others outside of my college.
        </p>

        <h5>Programming wasn't that good at Oxford</h5>
        <h6>Imperative programming</h6>
        <p>
          The C++ course taught by Željko Jurić at ETF was very good. The course Imperative Programming in Scala at Oxford 
          was not nearly as good, mostly due to the fact that it used to be a course taught
          in both Hilary and Trinity which is no longer the case. There used to be Imperative Programming 1,2, and 3 each taking 4 weeks to cover 
          but now all three parts are squished into 8 weeks making the course feel rushed and not well thought out. Also, C++ at ETF required more 
          hands-on work and was more practical than Scala at Oxford. This was impossible to achieve at Oxford due to the fact that the course is now only 8 weeks long 
          and students have other very demanding courses to take at the same time. It would be impossible to implement the C++ homework exercises at Oxford.
          This is a shame because I've heard first-hand from multiple people at Oxford that they don't feel that they put in enough time programming on a computer
          during the degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          IP at Oxford was very focused on invariant, variants, pre/postconditions, datatype invariants, and other formal methods for making 
          sure that the code is correct.
          This is not a bad thing, but it was not very practical. I think that the course would be much better if it was taught in a more practical way, 
          similar to the C++ course at ETF.
        </p>
        <h6>Functional programming</h6>
        <p>
          The Functional Programming course in Haskell was very <em>interesting...</em> Coming in with a significant amount of programming experience, I was
          surprised that this course was the first programming (even computer science) course of the degree. I think they just assume that everyone 
          has a solid programming experience in an imperative programming languages prior to starting their degree at Oxford. Some people said that they teach 
          FP in the first term because most people usually don't have much 
          experience in FP when starting their degree, thus leveling the playing field. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This subject was hard. It felt like you should have read at least one book on Haskell before starting the course.
          </p>
        <p>
          The course was strange to say the least. I think learning functional programming 
          before some C-adjacent language is a mistake.
        </p>

        <h5>No geometric intuition</h5>
        <p>
          The most drastic difference between ETF and Oxford when it comes to mathematics was how linear algebra was taught.
          At ETF, we were encouraged to use geometric intuition and visualizations of the concepts. We would draw planes, vectors, and 
          hyperplanes to solve certain problems. At Oxford, we had none of that. The linear algebra course was very abstract and
          <b>we didn't draw a single plane or vector for the whole duration of the course</b>. The course was very algebraic and 
          abstract, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it was a big change for me. I had to learn to think in a more abstract way and not 
          rely on my well-developed geometric intuition. AS mentioned, ETF's Linear Algebra was based on MIT's 18.06 Linear 
          Algebra course. This course is very geometric and visual due to the approach of Gilbert Strang.
          <p>
          <em> This is an example where I felt that my knowledge from ETF was not very useful to me, and even a hindrance at times (as the lack 
            of visualization frustrated me). I had similar issues with Analysis where I felt that things were moving too slow at Oxford. </em>
            </p>
          <p>
          For reference, I scored 99.5/100 on Linear Algebra at ETF and 81/100 on Mathematics 1 
          (an exam that encompasses Linear Algebra and Groups) at Oxford.
          </p>
        <p>
          I don't regret taking the MIT version of Linear Algebra at ETF as it was a good course and I learned a lot from it. Now that it doesn't
          affect my performance on exams, I cherrish the fact that I have these two very distinct approaches to linear algebra "mastered".
        </p>
        
        <h4> What worked better at Oxford?</h4>
        <h5>Much, much greater focus on self study</h5>
        <p>
          I would say that I spent more than 70% of my academic time at Oxford doing work in my room. For me this would usually mean I would spend
          around 4-6 hours per day working on problem sheets, reading books, lecture notes, and studying for exams.
        </p>
        <h6>A typical day</h6>
        <p>
          At ETF, my day would look like: 
          <ul>
            <li>Wake up between 7 and 8 AM.</li>
            <li>Take the bus (25-50 minutes) to get to Sarajevo.</li>
            <li>Listen to lectures that last 45 minutes from 9 AM to around 2 PM.</li>
            <li>On most days, I stay longer because of tutorials.</li>
            <li>I would usually leave around 3 PM and arrive back home (if I wasn't working that day) at around 4:30 PM</li>
          </ul>
          At Oxford, my day would look like:
          <ul>
            <li>Wake up between 8 and 9 AM. </li>
            <li>Walk to lectures at the department of Maths or CS from my college (15 minutes). Most times I would walk with
              friends from my college.
            </li>
            <li>Attend letures from 10 AM to 2 PM at the latest. Most days I would only have around 2.5 hours of lectures.</li>
            <li> Walk back to college and have lunch at 12:00.</li>
            <li> Go back to my room and work on problem sheets until tutorials/revision classes start. Each tutorial lasts an hour and 
              we usually have 2-4 tutorials per week.
            </li>
            <li> Have dinner at 5 PM. </li>
            <li> Work and rest from 5 PM to 11:30 PM. </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, I would spend less time in formal lectures or tutorials at Oxford than at ETF. I would use the extra 
          time to work by myself in my room.
        </p>
        <h6>Tutorials</h6>
        <p> The tutorials I had at ETF were not effective. The issue, in my opinion, is that students don't try the problems by themselves 
          before the tutorial class where the tutor solves them. This means that the students don't learn how to solve the problems by themselves and
          ultimately creates a huge waste of time for 95% of students. It's usually not the students' fault that they don't try the problems by themselves 
          prior to the tutorial as the problems are usually released quite late and close to the actual tutorial (at times, we only got the questions after 
          the tutorial had already started). What I always did was try to solve the problems before the tutor covers them during the tutorial. Usually the 
          questions weren't too hard I would actually manage to do this. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The tutorials at ETF are also held in a large classroom with around 20-30 students. The tutor usually solves the problems on the board and explains them to the class.
          Usually what happens is that some students just copy down the tutor's solution in their notebooks and then go home and either forget about it or 
          waste time later trying to understand the solution (which again, is not as effective as trying to solve the problem by yourself).
        </p>
        <p>
          At Oxford, the tutorials are much more effective. The tutors expect you to have tried the problems before the tutorial and they will 
          ask you to explain your solution to the problem. This means that you actually learn how to solve the problems by yourself and not just 
          listen to the tutor solving them for you. The tutors at Oxford are also much more knowledgeable and experienced than the tutors at ETF.
          They are usually PhD students or postdocs who have a lot of experience in teaching and usually know how to explain things well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tutorials are usually 1 tutor and 2-3 students per tutorial. This means that you get a lot of individual attention and
          you can ask questions and get help with the problems you struggled with. The tutors are also very approachable and 
          willing to help you with any questions you have. This is something that I really like about the Oxford tutorials.
          Some tutors are very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject they teach. Some just want to get the job done.
          The
        </p>
        <p>
          Having said this, I didn't find the Oxford tutorials immensely more helpful than the ETF tutorials. At ETF is still had a direct 
          connection to the tutors as I was one of the best students in my cohort and I would often ask questions and get help with the problems 
          I struggled with. <b> In conclusion, ETF had tutorials where you'd come and listen to someone explain solutions to problems you've not attempted,
            at Oxford you have tutorials where you come and listen to someone explain solutions to problem you've likely already solved.
          </b>
        </p>
        <h5>Selling point (digression)</h5>
        <p> The tutorial system should be one of the main selling points of Oxford and Cambridge University. The tuition for international students for Maths and 
          Computer Science is around £50,000 per year. Including living costs which amount to around £15,000 per year, the total cost of studying at Oxford
          is around <b>£65,000</b> per year (amounting to around <b>£200,000</b> for a 3-year course when including inflation). This is a lot of money. 
          I think that this is an insane amount of money to pay for a degree. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Domestic students pay around £9,250 per year for tuition and around £15,000 for living costs, totaling to around £24,250 per year (around £72,750 for a 3-year course).
          This is a lot of money for a UK student but it is not nearly as much as for an international student. <b>International students pay around 5 times as much tuition.</b>

          Tutorials are private in nature. <b>One tutor tutors one to two students at a time. You essentially have a 1 hour private lesson from the tutor.</b> Usually 
            tutorials are held in other colleges where the tutor is based.

        <h5>Getting the best grade requires at least 70% while at ETF it's 95%</h5>
        <p>
          Why is the bar so low for the best grade at Oxford? Because the exams contain very hard questions that require novel ideas to solve.
          The questions are not designed to be solved by rote learning or by applying a formula. The Oxford exams go beyond just testing whether 
          you grasp the material and can apply it to somewhat unfamiliar situations. They test your ability of coming up with new ideas and
          applying them to the problems at hand. This is something that I really like about the Oxford exams. After finishing the first year, I feel like I have 
          become smarter and more capable in most intelectual tasks and I attribute this feeling, for the most part, to this fact.
          </p>
          <p> At ETF, it was never about coming up with new ideas or applying them to the problems at hand. It was always about being mechanically 
          good at applying the formulas and rote learning. My brain was mostly concerned about the amount of marks I would lose on an exam and not on 
          how many marks I would get. At Oxford, the situation was totally different. The questions were so hard that I was never concerned about the number of marks I 
          would lose, but rather how many marks I would get.
          </p><p> Another thing I disliked about ETF was that there were a lot of bonus points that were given away for doing some extra work or for doing something 
          extra (like filling out a survey even - something completely unrelated to the course). This meant that some people would have more than 100 points at the end 
          of the year in that subject. At times I even felt professors being more charitable to better students and giving them more points than they probably deserved.
          I felt this for some of my papers as well. This made the whole course feel less serious and more "chill" which, in my opinion, is not a good thing.
          <br> For me, one of the key components for pushing my own boundaries at Oxford was the pressure and seriousness of the exams. <b>The fact that none of your work
          throughout the year counts towards your final grade and that you have to do well on the finals to get a good grade is a great motivator.</b>
          <br>

        <h5>(shocking) Oxford is much more academically demanding</h5>
        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          <p class="mb-0 small"><em>"Students should seek advice from their tutors if they find it impossible to meet their academic obligations without 
          spending significantly longer than 48 hours per week on academic study on a regular basis."</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The amount of work I put in at Oxford was significantly higher than at ETF. I would estimate between 2 and 3 times more work per week.
          Each week we had 4-5 problem sheets to do, each with 5-10 questions. The questions were usually quite challenging and 
          required a lot of time to solve. The last one or two questions on each problem sheet were usually optional and harder than the rest but 
          most "good" students would try to solve them anyway (either their own drive or social pressure from colleagues).
          I would spend 4-6 hours per problem sheet, so in total around 20 hours per week just on problem sheets. 
          We also had multiple labs throughout the year, 2 labs in Functional Programming, 2 in Imperative Programming and 1 in 
          Design and Analysis of Algorithms. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This made me feel like I was constantly working on something and 
          that I had little time to relax or do anything else. For the last 4 weeks of Hilary and Trinity I almost exclusively worked 
          on university-related things throughout my time in Oxford. At ETF, I would start studying for some midterms a few days 
          before the exam and I would still usually be top 3 in my cohort on
          that exam and not lose many points (1-4 points). Of course, I had to put in some work during the semester, but it was 
          not comparable.
        </p>

        <h5>Oxford pushes your boundaries</h5>
        <p>
        As mentioned above, the exams at Oxford are hard and require you to come up with new ideas and apply them to the problems at hand.
        When I say new ideas, I mean that you have to come up with a new way of solving the problem, usually something that you haven't seen before.
        This reminded me a lot of math competitions like the IMO (but of course not as hard). ETF had almost none of this. People put in more effort
        to come up with interesting questions at Oxford.
        </p>

              This question was particularly interesting because it required you to think outside the box. It reminded me of some IMO problems.

        <p>
          As an example, take a look at this <a href="/images/blog/oxford_vs_etf/oxford/probabilityps5.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          probability problem sheet</a>. It's interesting because it has a lot of questions that aren't standard and require you to think (a bit) 
          outside the box (especially the last question which took me more than an hour to fully solve).
        </p>
        <p>
          Analysis was hard and required a lot of creativity to solve certain questions. Here's a favourite question from some sheet:

        <p>
          In Computer Science, the Design and Analysis of Algorithms course was very interesting and required a lot of creativity to solve the problems. Here's a question
            that we had on a problem sheet but is also a <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/description/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
              LeetCode hard problem: Merge k sorted lists.</a>

          I pushed through a personal boundary in this course. I managed to prove to myself that I can solve hard algorithmic problems even though I didn't go to 
          the IOI (International Olympiad in Informatics) to which a proportion of the students in my year have gone and won medals.

          Continuous Maths (a course that is a mix of Vector Calculus and Numerical Methods) was advanced for a first-year course. The
          <a href="/images/blog/oxford_vs_etf/oxford/cm-notes.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lecture notes</a> were quite long and chock full of content.

          If you're studying Maths/Computer Science/Statistics at either Oxford or Cambridge, you will likely get a good job after graduation.
          Really good students often go down the "Quantitative Finance" route where starting salaries range £100,000 - £250,000. Some of my friends 
          had internships at Jane Street, Citadel, Optiver and earned around £30,000 - £40,000 for 2-3 months of work. When considering the jobs 
          you could get in Bosnia and Herzegovina, this is an absurdly high salary. Food costs in the UK are actually lower than in Bosnia (if you're smart). 
          The large costs are rent and utilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from high salaries, you can actually pursue academia and research and still earn good money in the UK. There is also many grants and 
          opportunities for promising researchers (some of my tutors got grants upwards of £400,000 to work on their research).
        </p>
        
        <h2>Concluding remarks</h2>
        <p>
          If someone were to give me the opportunity to go back in time and immediately start my degree at Oxford after finishing high school, I would decline. 
          I am happy that I had the opportunity to study at ETF Sarajevo and that I was able to meet smart people in Sarajevo. I cherrish the memories I made there. 
          I am happy that when I come back to my country I can 
          call up some of my friends from ETF for a coffee and talk about university experiences, life, and the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          By attending ETF, I got to know the best students and professors in my country. I feel connected to the community of students there and I am happy that 
          I was able to contribute and be a part of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, I am glad I spent a year doing an engineering degree. This gave me a pretty good grounding in reality that helped me in projects I 
          worked on during the year. Sometimes studying at Oxford feels like sitting in an ivory tower and not being able to relate to the real world.
          I got to experience the real world and all its challenges at ETF and in the projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thirdly, I had the opportunity to listen to Jurić's lectures. These lectures still hold up for some of the best lectures I have ever attended, beating 
          most Oxford lectures by a significant margin. The subject Jurić teaches called "Tehnike Programiranja" (Programming Techniques) is a very good subject and holds up well to the 
          difficulty of courses I have taken so far at Oxford. I also had the opportunity to listen to a couple of lectures on Numerical Methods by Jurić while on vacation from Oxford. 
          That was a really wholesome throwback.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, I understand the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina much better. I understand the challenges that students face in my country and I am more aware of 
          the problems that exist. I'm optimistic about the prospect of eventually returning to Bosnia and giving back to the community that helped me grow as a person.
