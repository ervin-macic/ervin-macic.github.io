        <h2 class="blog-post-title"> Context</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">Jul 17, 2025</p>
        <p> As of the time of writing this post, I have just finished my first year of the (integrated Master's) course called Mathematics and Computer Science at Oxford.  
            Before coming to Oxford I studied at ETF Sarajevo, a public university in Bosnia and Herzegovina known to be the best engineering university in the country.  
            I finished the first year of the "Raƒçunarstvo i Informatika" (Computer Science) course there. Both at ETF and Oxford I did really well and I was one of the top students in my year.
            As one would expect, the first year of undergraduate study is not very specialized and is closer to an introduction to the field. I had the belief that this would mean that some if not most 
            of my knowledge from ETF would be useful at Oxford. I was mostly wrong and will go into this in detail below.
        </p>
        <h2>Subjects</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">The first year at Oxford is called "Prelims" and it is a year of introduction to the course. The subjects I took at Oxford were:
        Mathematics department: Analysis 1, 2 & 3, Linear Algebra 1 & 2, Probability, Groups and Group Actions
        Computer Science department: Functional Programming (in Haskell), Imperative Programming (in Scala), Desing and Analysis of Algorithms, and Continuous Maths. 
        </p>
            At ETF I took the following subjects: Mathematics I, Mathematics II, Physics I, Introductory Programming in C, Programming , and English.
        </p>
        <h2>Caveats</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta">My course at Oxford is <strong>definitely not</strong> an engineering course. The course I partially attended at ETF was called Computer Science 
        but felt more close to Computer Engineering or just Engineering during the first year. The subjects I had during</p>

            <b>Assume:</b> the body is launched inside Earth's gravitational field, there is no air resistance, disregard curvature of the Earth. Up is positive, down is negative (necessary for velocities).
            <br><br>
            <b>Start: </b>Let the object be flung into the air at an angle $\theta$ with initial speed $u$. Gravity acts on our body perpendicularly to the surface of the Earth so our object will be
            affected in the vertical $y$ direction. Let our vertical velocity at time $t$ be $v_{y}^{(t)}$ and let our horizontal velocity be $v_{x}^{(t)}$. <br> <br> Notice that
            since nothing exerts force on our body in the $x$ direction our horizontal velocity stays the same so $v_{x}^{(t)} = v_{x}^{(0)}$ for all $t$. <br><br>
            Our vertical velocity is trickier since we have to account for the deacceleration $g=9.81 m/s^2$ in the vertical direction, thus our vertical velocity
            at time $t$ is $v_{y}^{(t)} = v_{y}^{(0)}\cdot t - g\cdot t$.
            <br>Our displacement in the $x$ direction is just equal to $s_{x}^{(t)} = v_{x}^{(t)} \cdot t$ since this is
            motion without acceleration. We know that $v_{x}^{t} = v_{x}^{0} = u \cos(\theta)$ so $s_x^{(t)} = u \cdot t\cos(\theta)$. Denote $x_t=s_x^{(t)}$ and $y_t=s_y^{(t)}$<br>

          </div>
          <br>
            Our $y$ displacement is $s_{y}^{(t)} = v_{y}^{(0)} \cdot t - \frac{g\cdot t^2}{2}$ or $y_t = u \sin(\theta)t - \frac{g\cdot t^2}{2}$.<br><br>
            Now to figure out the equation of our trajectory with $x$ input and $y$ output we need to get $y_t$ in terms of $x_t$. After rearranging equations and boring algebra we get the following: <br>
            <div style="overflow-x:auto; overflow-y: hidden">\[ y = \left (-\frac{g}{2u^2\cos(\theta)} \right )x^2 + (\tan(\theta))x = (\ldots)x^2+(\ldots)x \]</div>
            The above "$\ldots$" represent constants. I also omitted $t$ in the index of $x,y$.

            <br>
            A free fall/vertical shot can be thought of as an infinitely narrow parabola or whenever an object is flying through the air it keeps this parabolic shape (without air resistance).

          <h3>Back to Mario</h3>
          <p>
            Now that we know that every throw traces a parabola, we are ready to tackle the Mario game. Could you make an impossible level in this game?
            Could you place the coins in such a way that no Mario's jump can catch them all? <br>
            
            <b>If you're given some coins, how can you determine the jump without try and fail?</b> <br> <br>
            Mathematically said, given $n$ points, does there exist a parabola that fits through all of these points? It should be obvious that the answer
            is yes. Place three collinear points parallel to the ground and you can't fit any parabola. Or even easier, place two vertical points. By definition
            of a function they can't both lie on the graph.<br> <br>
            <b>The actual probability of making a possible level with three or more coins is $0$.</b> <br>
            But it is obviously possible. Just work backwards from the parabola itself and mark however many points you want.<br>
            The problem of finding a graph to <b>fit</b> a set of points is called an <b>interpolation problem.</b> Interpolating means finding a function that fits
            the given data points. There are <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation">many techniques of interpolation</a>, but I'll stick 
            with <b>Lagrange interpolation</b> because it is one of the most fundamental ones and related to olympiad mathematics.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            $\star$ The Lagrange interpolating polynomial is the unique polynomial of lowest degree that interpolates a given set of data. Given a data set of coordinate pairs
            $(x_i,y_i)$ with $0 \leq i \leq k$, the Lagrange polynomial $L(x)$ has degree $\leq k$ and assumes each value at the corresponding input $L(x_i) = y_i$.  $\star$
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that fitting polynomials ends up just being $n$ equations with $n$ variables. If we have $n$ points to fit to a polynomial of degree $n$ there are
            infinitely many such polynomials. If we have $n+1$ points, then there exists exactly one polynomial of degree $n$ (or none depending if we take the restriction that $x_i$ are sorted).
            Obviously, the Lagrange polynomial can have degree less than $n$ if the given points lie on a curve of smaller degree.

            It turns out that this polynomial is relatively easy to find. <br>
            For simplicity I'll solve it for $n=3$. We want to find the parabola that goes through the points $(x_0,y_0),(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2)$.<br>
            The simplest way to achieve such a quadratic is if it looked something like this:
            <div style="overflow-x: auto; overflow-y: hidden">\[ p(x) = y_0 \cdot A + y_1 \cdot B + y_2 \cdot C \]</div>
            where we can make the letters turn into zero when needed. Obviously $A,B,C$ shouldn't be constants. Let them be polynomials and at least one should have 
            degree $2$. We need $A(x_0) = 1$ and 
            $A(x_1)=A(x_2)=0$. How can we achieve this? Simply take $A(x) = \alpha (x-x_1)(x-x_2)$ but we also need $A(x_0)=1$ so $\alpha = \frac{1}{(x_0-x_1)(x_0-x_2)}$.
            Hence the first term is $y_0 \cdot \frac{(x-x_1)(x-x_2)}{(x_0-x_1)(x_0-x_2)}$. Repeating for the remaining $B,C$ we find the general cubic to be:
            <div style="overflow-x: auto; overflow-y: hidden"> \[ p(x) = y_0 \cdot \frac{(x-x_1)(x-x_2)}{(x_0-x_1)(x_0-x_2)}+ y_1 \cdot \frac{(x-x_0)(x-x_2)}{(x_1-x_0)(x_1-x_2)} + y_2 \cdot \frac{(x-x_0)(x-x_1)}{(x_2-x_0)(x_2-x_0)} \ (\bigstar)\]</div>
            <br> Here's an example of a fitted parabola to three points (thanks to the SciPy library we have an inbuilt function): <br> <br>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/FrequentErvin/0e83419db101c81edbf04392f6a11687.js"></script>
            <div class="px-5 pt-2 my-2 text-center">
              <img src="/images/blog/lagrangeparabola.png" style=" width: 100%; height: auto; max-width: 600px;">
            </div>
            The general polynomial for $n$ points is analogous and should really be written with brackets:
            <div style="overflow-x: auto; overflow-y: hidden"> \[ p(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \left ( y_i \frac{(x-x_0) \cdots (x-x_{i-1}) (x-x_{i+1}) \cdots (x-x_n)}{(x_i-x_0) \cdots (x_i-x_{i-1}) (x_i - x_{i+1}) \cdots (x_i - x_n)} \right )\]</div>
            Note the missing $x_i$ in the numerator and denominator. Also make sure that this polynomial is of degree $n$ indeed and that we are fitting $n+1$ points starting from index $0$.

            <br>
            <br>
            In conclusion, for any given $n+1$ points we can find a polynomial of degree $n$ that passes through all of those points. Another kind of interpolation is the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_polynomial">Newton Interpolation.</a> This kind of polynomial can be very useful in general and even serve as a relatively naive 
            technique in data science where predicting outputs given inputs is crucial. <br> <br> 
            For example, it is often better than <b>Linear Interpolation</b> and <b>Nearest Neighbors Interpolation</b>
             since it avoids any jaggedness by its polynomial nature. It does have its problems though. It is usually not useful for large sets of data points since it usually sky-rockets into 
             space at the edges of the interval. This is called the <b>Runge's phenomenon</b>: 
             <br> <br>

              Notice the great spikes at around $x=2$ and $x=13$ (one goes beyond the screen). That's typically not what we want. A famous example is 
              interpolating the function $f(x) = \frac 1{1+25x^2}$ at points $x_i = \frac{2i}{n}-1$:

              To avoid this in data science we use cubic splines which mimic a smooth polynomial passing through our points. You sort your datapoints by 
              their $x$ values and go left to right and fit each two consecutive points with a (typically) cubic curve. We use cubics because we need to be 
              able to have the same slopes (derivatives) at the ends of the intervals in order for the transition to be smooth. You can check that parabolas
              wouldn't suffice there. So at the end we have smooth connections between points: <br> <br>
              <script src="https://gist.github.com/FrequentErvin/f8bd9f30b9f7b48d49974d21f4397486.js"></script>

              </div>
              <br> <br>
              Now notice the smoothness of the transitions. This is thanks to the equal derivatives. We have basically made a graph out of $n$ different smaller
              cubics. Read more about what the algorithm for constructing these cubics looks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_interpolation">here.</a> Cute! 
            </p>
            Coming back to our Mario game, it's now trivial to solve every level by simply reading off the coordinates
            of three distinct coins and putting them into $(\bigstar)$. If the level is possible, not more than three coins are needed
            because they uniquely determine our parabola/jump. The game does get less precise as you go through the levels and just
            eyeballing works out but where's the fun in that?

              <dd> Let $ p$ be a prime number and $ f$ an integer polynomial of degree $ d$ such that $ f(0) = 0,f(1) = 1$ and $ f(n)$ is congruent to $ 0$ or $ 1$ modulo $ p$ for every integer $ n$. Prove that $ d\geq p - 1$.</dd>
              <dt>Problem 2</dt>
              <dd>You are given $N$ such that $ n \ge 3$. We call a set of $N$ points on a plane acceptable if their abscissae are unique, and each of the points is coloured either red or blue. Let's say that a polynomial $P(x)$ divides a set of acceptable points either if there are no red dots above the graph of $P(x)$, and below, there are no blue dots, or if there are no blue dots above the graph of $P(x)$ and there are no red dots below. Keep in mind, dots of both colors can be present on the graph of $P(x)$ itself. For what least value of k is an arbitrary set of $N$ points divisible by a polynomial of degree $k$?</dd>
