        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p> 
        As of the time of writing this post, I just finished the first year of the integrated Master's 
        course Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Oxford (Pembroke College). I spent time writing 
        this post on and off throughout the year.
        </p>

        <h5>ETF</h5>
        <p>
        ETF is a wreck. The study conditions at ETF are really bad. The classrooms were old, the computers were slow. I remember taking a final exam
        in the subject Introductory Programming in C and the computers were so slow that I couldn't even open tabs in the browser to access the exam. 
        The internet was also constantly down. I did poorly on this exam and when I took the resit I scored 29/30 when working on proper computers.

        <b>There was no running water in most places I had lectures in.</b> These include the A1, A2, A3 "buildings" (basically long, short houses) which
        are the main buildings where most of the lectures take place for first year students. To me and some other people, this was absurd.

          The signes stayed up from November 2023 and weren't taken down by the time I finished my first year in June 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interestingly, not many students complained about this. I think that this is due to the fact that most students at ETF are used to this kind of
          environment and they don't think their voice matters. I think that this is a big problem in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where people are used to 
          bad conditions and don't protest much by nature. Students might complain about the conditions to each other but I didn't see any real
          initiatives being taken to improve the conditions at ETF from either the students or the faculty.
        </p>
        <p>
        I distinctly remember needing to go to the toilet during a lecture break while it was 
        raining outside and I didn't bring an umbrella. The closest toilet was a 3-5 minute walk away in another building across the campus. 
        There was a toilet in the Faculty of Pharmacy building but the janitor there was very strict and would sometimes not let you in if you
        entered with multiple people at once. Even if this weren't the case, it still felt bad to have to go to the toilet in another building
        and not in the faculty building. I am not sure if this is still the case, but I hope it is not.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also remember having to take an exam in the A3 building in the early morning near the end of the first year. There was a huge 
          puddle of wine on the tiles immediately in front of the entrance to A3. The cleaning staff was trying to clean it fast so we could 
          enter the building to queue for our exam. They were struggling to clean it due to the fact that there was no running water in this area 
          of the campus. They used water bottles they filled up in the main building. During the night drunk
          (homeless?) people would often walk into campus and get drunk on benches near the buildings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exams that were held on Saturdays were usually held in the A3 building. During winter, I remember doing my linear algebra finals in a freezing room 
          wearing mittens and a jacket. The heating was not working in the building (as they presumably don't heat it during the weekend) and it was freezing cold outside.
        </p>
        <p> Also, there is an ablution room and a prayer room inside the A3 building. As there was no water, people would 
          take woodoo using water bottles. Since there was no water, it was hard to keep the room clean.
        </p>
        <div class="px-5 pt-2 my-2 text-center">

              The (filthy) ablution room in the A3 building at ETF Sarajevo. The room is dirty and the floor is wet.
              The room is used by students to wash themselves before going to the prayer room. You probably walked out 
              dirtier than you walked in.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>It is worth noting that the STELEKS reading room, abloution room, and prayer room are taken care of by students. Before water became an issue, 
          these places were usually much more clean.
        </p>
        <h4>Quality of life</h4>
        <h5> Air quality </h5>
        <p>
          Air pollution in Sarajevo is a big problem in the winter months. There is smog so thick you can barely drive. During these 
          months, Sarajevo usually ranks among the top 3 most air polluted cities in the world. People use coal, wood, and allegedly tires for heating.
          To my knowledge, the government hasn't done many useful things about this issue so far.   
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn't something directly related to
          ETF but is still very important to mention. I bet this issue will cause a spike in lung cancer cases in the future in Sarajevo. 
          As a student who had to travel from a neighbouring town to Sarajevo every work day, I was often exposed for prolonged
          time intervals to the severe smog (in the winter months).

          At Oxford, lots of cars are electric and the air quality is much better. The city is also much cleaner than Sarajevo. There is an abundance 
          of green spaces and parks. The city is also very walkable and bikeable, which makes it easy to get around without a car. Owning a car
          in Oxford seems to be a bit of a hassle as parking is very expensive and hard to find. Most people opt for bikes. The public transport is also very good, with buses running
          frequently and on time. Getting from my home to ETF Sarajevo usually was a huge hassle as the buses were often late or didn't come at all.
          It also wasn't rare to have people fainting from overcrowding in the buses during rush hour and having fights break out between passengers.

            The table tennis table in STELEKS would be the greatest attraction during lecture breaks. Lots of filth would build up under it though. It was

                  During some lectures like the ones on Programming Techniques in C++, the lecture room would be so overcrowded that people would sit on the stairs.
                  The lecturer would lock the door to the lecture room and not let anyone in after the stairs get filled up. This wasn't too common, only for the first 
                  couple of weeks of the summer term. Then later in the term people would start skipping lectures and the lecture room would be less crowded.

                  Immediately next to the old carpet, there was a remnant of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a Sarajevo Rose. It would have been nice if it was at least 
                  filled in with red resin or something, but it was just a hole in the ground with some concrete filling it. A Sarajevo Rose is a memorial for the victims of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
                  where a mortar shell exploded and likely injured or killed people. The hole is usually filled in with red resin. Here the concrete filling is just a tripping hazard.

                  Some people still opened them. The next day and for the remainder of my first year at ETF, the windows were nailed shut. We would keep the door of the lecture room 
                  open to let some fresh air in. The lecture room was usually very stuffy.

        <h4>Food</h4>
        <p>
          There is one cantene at ETF Sarajevo that serves food. The food, in my opinion, is usually not very good. The prices are cheaper than 
          at Oxford but the quality is not comparable. 
        </p>

              The food is usually very good and the portions are decent. An average meal costs 4-6 pounds. Lots of vegan, vegetarian, and halal options.

        <h4>Communal spaces</h4>
        <p>
          Oxford has <b>a lot of libraries and spaces for people to work in and outside of the departmental buildings</b>. Each of the 30+ colleges has 
          its own study spaces and designated places for fun and relaxation. These are kept tidy and modern.
        </p>
        <p>
        ETF has one classroom-style room that is taken care of by the student organisation "Steleks". The room is allegedly a study room but it is usually occupied by students 
        playing table tenis or fifa on a locked-up playstation available in the room (?). It gets very loud. Not a good place to study. But it is a decent place to 
        hang out with friends and play games. There are some books around the room but I've never seen anyone actually using them.
        </p>
        <h3> Miscellaneous</h3>
        <h4>Weather</h4>
        <p>
          Weather in Oxford was fine. It was usually cloudy but very rarely did it pour rain. The weather was usually pleasant and I never felt 
          miserable having to walk to the department from my college. The weather in Sarajevo during really cold winter is sometimes miserable.
          Also, during summer months, the weather in Sarajevo can be very hot and humid.

        <h3>Oxford</h3>
        <p>Oxford is the most magical place I have ever vistied. </p>

        <h4>Formal Hall</h4>
        <p>
        Formal halls are formal dinners at Oxford colleges that happen around twice per week. During Michaelmas term, we 
        "had" to go to two formal halls per week. The food is usually very good and the portions are decent (at least at Pembroke College, I've 
        heard horror stories from other colleges). The dress code is formal, so you have to wear a suit or a tuxedo.
