        <h4>My relationship to the post</h4>
        <p>
            After participating in the Winter Applied Rationality Camp 2022, I learned about the <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Effective Altruism </a> movement 
            and about organizations such as <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> LessWrong </a> , <a href="https://80000hours.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 80,000 Hours </a>, 
            <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Open Philanthropy </a>, etc. The ideas, goals, and values these organizations have and the ways they are going about achieving those goals has since then allured my interest and kept 
            me looking to answer my own doubts and understand my place in this world better. This led me to discover vast amounts of information online and led me to hear and learn about 
            ideas such as expected values (in decision-making), scope insensitivity, counterfactual impact, Bayesian logic and Popperian critical rationalism/falsification. <br>
            These and many more kept me intrigued and hooked me into learning as much as I could.  <br>
            I've had the opportunity to read the post through applications for Atlas twice and through the Non-trivial fellowship. Each time I glean some more insight I didn't catch on the previous readings. I will keep this updated with whatever else comes to mind. 
            Currently, as of writing this, the whole post is short but I believe it won't stay that way for long.
        </p>
        <p>
            The very first post I read about this philosophy was <a target="_blank" href="https://mindingourway.com/on-caring/">"On caring"</a> by Nate Soars. Although it was the first thing I read, it has stuck with me the most.
        </p><br>
        <h4>Summary & Initial thoughts</h4>
        <p>
          The post goes against the traditional ways of doing good while pointing to important changes in our attitude towards caring about pressing problems. It is one of my go-to posts to share, which has a high probability 
          of being accepted, understood, and internalized by the receiver.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Us and numbers</h4>
        <p>
          The post urges us to action because it's the right thing to do, rather than guilting us into it. One of the first remarks the author makes is that we, here in the present, are responsible for the coming generations of which there will be millions.
           He repeats that we should not feel guilty for not being able to save all of them or that we can't care about all of them, but we should try caring even when we don't feel it. He also looks at another type of insensitivity: 
           care insensitivity. 
          Again, this is another one of those concepts that people sometimes refuse to accept, and with good reason. We as a species are built such that we get satisfaction and "happy chemicals" in our brain by leveraging direct impact and actions. It's hard to get as good of a feeling from helping someone immediately in your vicinity and from helping 
          someone you will probably never meet in a developing country. <br> Some people think our brains are perfectly tuned tools that act 100% rationaly, with respect to our knowledge base. This is false in many 
          cases. Often our brain takes shortcuts, "hides" information from us, and does things that aren't completely aligned with our actual goals, but rather with some shallow pleasure optimizing goal or 
          purely catering to our survival instincts. 
          <br>
          <h4>Boxes</h4>
          Our brains like to label things in neat boxes, so when quantities get too large we can't allocate any label except enormous. As an example, sometimes when we're faced with huge numbers our brain just chalks them up and puts them in the labeled box "HUGE NUMBER"
           and does not have a good system set in place to deal with even bigger numbers. This can be extremely detrimental to our decision-making. The post mentions an example
          where people were willing to pay nearly the same amount of money in order to save 2000 birds from oil spills as they were to save 200,000 birds. This is astounding. It blew my mind the first time I read it. I immediately questioned a lot of my decision-making up until that point. Have I been truly thoughtful about my decisions 
          when big numbers popped up? I was also angry that I just now formalized this disturbing feeling I'd had for a while.<br>
          Although astounding, it is to be expected since for most of humanity we didn't have much use for such enormous numbers. Apples, rocks, etc. came in the magnitudes of tens, hundreds, even thousands. The post highlights 
          the fact that people truly can't "care" about more than roughly 150 people at any point.  <br>
          To someone who is open to thinking critically with these numbers, they discover they can't care about many problems beyond our scope, since we in fact can't! The ideas is that even though 
          we can't rationalize the concept of helping that many people and feeling the direct impact of our help, does not mean we can't and shouldn't do the caring. <br>
          <br><h5>Impact is cumulative</h5>
          An important aspect I want to explore here is not only the number of people we're helping but also the amount of help we're giving. Rarely any one person can significantly help a large number of people. 
          Obviously such a person would have to be incredibly powerful and well-off which is not the case for most. The next mental blockade that happens, that stops us from doing the helping is the apparent insignificance of 
          our impact. If you donate $50 to starving people in Yemen, you might feed a family for a few days, but in the grand scheme of things that doesn't make a big difference. Instead, you should donate to organizations which are tasked 
          with effectively helping those people, who can do far more with the same amount of money and have a greater positive impact in the long term.
          <br> 
          In our day-to-day lives we frequently encounter these dilemas. The inner mechanisms fighting against our System 1 e.g. "You shouldn't throw that piece of trash there since it pollutes the environment".
        </p><br>
        <h4>Takeaways</h4>
        <p>My main takeaway was; "Courage isn't about being fearless, it's about being able to do the right thing even if you're afraid." 
        and the notion to try anyway even if there is not enough money, 
        time, or effort to do what must be done. It isn't about being afraid of 
        something material but instead taking risks that ultimately could have a much greater counterfactual net positive on the world. <br>
        A key message is also to be deeply analytical about all things both directly "mathsy" and not, such as everyday decisions. In my opinion, the 
        execution of this message is very satisfying in the post with many thought-provoking arguments in the context of doing good.
      </p> 
        <br>
        <h4>More personal reflections</h4>
        <p>Reading the book "80,000 hours" and getting to the section about being "incredilby lucky" to be living in a developed country I couldn't immediately relate.
          I live in Bosnia, a country in the Balkans which has less than one tenth the average GDP of the US. The situation isn't great by any means, but we're not 100 times 
          less developed than the US like, say Somalia or Eritrea. Yet, the majority of people live pay check to pay check. Altruism is much riskier for people in such countries than 
        anywhere else. The chance of war could ultimately make your last spending the crucial decider of whether you survive the next year or not. <br>
        But the situation isn't so bad and I'm lucky enough to have made my own opportunities to live better without relying on my parents' income. I hope to be in a position where 
      I could give a portion of my earnings back to other people and continue the cycle. Importantly, give where it matters the most. </p>
