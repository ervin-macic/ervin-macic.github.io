        <p class="blog-post-meta">November 12, 2021</p>
        <p> This year's IMO was weird.. Sadly it was online again.</p>
          <p>I've learned one lesson through it. To solve most* IMO P1/P4 I ask myself two questions: What is <strong>enough</strong> to finish?  What would be helpful if it were true?</p>
        <p> I will be discussing only P1,P4 and P5 since those are the ones I tried the most on the competition. </p>
        <table class="table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Problem No.</th>
              <th>Mean P#</th>
              <th>Num (P# = 7)</th>

        <p>By the above data, it seems that this year's P1,P4,P5 weren't as easy as say 2019: </p>

        Even more striking are the mean and perfect scores on P1 and P4 in 2014 for example:

        <h4 class="blog-post-title mt-4">Small discussion</h4>
        <p>My train of thought about this problem on the IMO was: induction? = quick no, since you can't guarantee anything will hold after moving from $n$ to $n+1$. The next thing I did was phrase it as a game: </p>
        <div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-12 mt-3">
              <div class="h-100 p-4 text-white bg-dark rounded-3">
                <h4>Rephrased problem</h4>
                <hr class="thick">
                <p>Boris and Ivan play a game. Boris chooses a positive integer $n$. Ivan writes the numbers $n, n+1, \ldots, 2 n$ each on different cards. Ivan wins if he can split these $n+1$ cards into two piles such that in each pile there aren't two cards that sum to a perfect square. For which $n$ does Boris have a winning strategy? </p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <p class="mt-4"> After I phrased it like this, it immediately came to me: When couldn't Ivan achieve his goal? The most logical way of trying to achieve his goal is to start greedy ordering the cards in each pile in such a way that he doesn't end up with two cards summing up to a perfect square. </p>
        <p class="mt-1"> When couldn't he do this? If for example he had to place a card with value $a$ in one of the two piles but there existed already two cards with value $b$ in the first pile and $c$ in the second pile such that $a+b$ and $a+c$ are perfect squares. Then I got the idea immediately. </p>
        <p class="mt-1"> What if I couldn't fix this situation? Since a fix would be to place $c$ with $b$ into the first pile, but this wouldn't work if $b+c$ is also a perfect square. If Ivan had this situation in his $n+1$ numbers, he couldn't win. </p>
        <h3 class="mb-4"> <i>ok now what?</i> </h3>
        <p class=" mb-3"> Well I need to see how oftenly such a triple occurs. Basically I solved the system $a+b=x^2$, $b+c=y^2$, $c+a=z^2$. What I mean by "solved" is: $b=x^2-a$ and $c=z^2-a$ so $b+c=(x^2-a)+(z^2-a)=y^2$ so $a=\frac{z^2+x^2-y^2}{2}$ and similarily: $(a,b,c)=(\frac{z^2+x^2-y^2}{2},\frac{x^2+y^2-z^2}{2},\frac{y^2+z^2-x^2}{2})$. Now I realised that basically if I pick $(x,y,z)$ I would get a corresponding triple of $(a,b,c)$ so I picked consecutive $x,y,z$ since those would lead to the "closest" $a,b,c$.</p>
        <p> Now I got $(a,b,c)=(\frac{x^2-4x}{2},\frac{x^2+2}{2},\frac{x^2+4x}{2})$ which means $x=2k$ (even) and then I got the triple $(a,b,c)=(2k^2-4k,2k^2+1,2k^2+4k)$. So if for some $k$ all three of these numbers belong in my $n+1$ numbers I'm done. <s>Proving such numbers exist for $n\geqslant 100$ is straightforward.</s> I struggled getting the bound as tight as the problem desired. I got $n \geq 106$ in the first 1.5h of the competition 
        but couldn't manage to figure out if my calculations were faulty or I was missing something. "Surely", I thought, "this is the way to solve the problem so I must have missed something while solving the quadratics..". Turns out I could have 
      just found examples for $n=100,\ldots,106$ which would have been much easier than trying to fix the quadratics. Lost one point because of this. Luckily, it wasn't a deciding point for the bronze medal. </p>

                <p>Let $\Gamma$ be a circle with centre $I$, and $A B C D$ a convex quadrilateral such that each of the segments $A B, B C, C D$ and $D A$ is tangent to $\Gamma$. Let $\Omega$ be the circumcircle of the triangle $A I C$. The extension of $B A$ beyond $A$ meets $\Omega$ at $X$, and the extension of $B C$ beyond $C$ meets $\Omega$ at $Z$. The extensions of $A D$ and $C D$ beyond $D$ meet $\Omega$ at $Y$ and $T$, respectively.

        <p class="mt-3">For some reason, this took me over 2 hours. I think I just got scared of the weird thing to prove and the fact that my diagram led me to believe it was harder than it actually was.</p>
        <p> First I reduced it to a sum of three lines by tangent segments: $AD=AS+SD=AP+DR$ similarily $CD=DS+CQ$ thus it's enough to prove $PX+XT+TR = QZ + ZY+ YS$.  </p>
        <p> At first I didn't think this was mega useful. After playing with angles for a long while i realised $\angle TIX = \angle YIZ$ which implies $XT = YZ$ and I knew I was done once I got this. </p>
        <p> Something trivial I didn't notice at first was that since $AI$ is the exterior angle bisector of $\angle XAY$ we must have $I$ is the midarc of $XY$ with $A$ hence $XI=YI$ and similarily $TI=ZI$ so we must have $TZ||XY$ and hence $TX=YZ$ (by symmetry). This was much faster than the angle chase I figured out. </p>
        <p> Now we're almost done since $\triangle YSI \cong \triangle XPI$ and so $YS=XP$ similarily $ZQ=TR$ and hence the conclusion!</p>

                <p>Two squirrels, Bushy and Jumpy, have collected 2021 walnuts for the winter. Jumpy numbers the walnuts from 1 through 2021, and digs 2021 little holes in a circular pattern in the ground around their favourite tree. The next morning Jumpy notices that Bushy had placed one walnut into each hole, but had paid no attention to the numbering. Unhappy, Jumpy decides to reorder the walnuts by performing a sequence of 2021 moves. In the $k$-th move, Jumpy swaps the positions of the two walnuts adjacent to walnut $k$.
                </br> </br>
                  Prove that there exists a value of $k$ such that, on the $k$-th move, Jumpy swaps some walnuts $a$ and $b$ such that $a < k < b$. </p>

        <p> So since P4 was not that easy for me, did not have enough time to fiddle enough with this problem which is sad. Now, nearly 6 months later, I sat down and solved it. It took me about 2.5 hours, which is not usually the case with P1/P4 problems on the IMO.</p>
